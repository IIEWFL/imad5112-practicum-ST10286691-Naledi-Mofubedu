how the app was made
main screen 
going be the requirement for the app i started with a basic and simple user interface and added edit text for the name for the song the artist how much the user rates the song and a comment the user can provide 
also added some buttons the exit button, the next button and the add buttton 
what this screen should do is after the user has clicked on it should take the use to the next screen  to view the details along with the details from the main screen
and the add button it should take the user to another there screen for them to add more to the playlist at least 4 times
the exit button should code the app
the display screen 
the user interface ha a very simpl build aswell  it has a display button to retrieve the data from the previous page and must be seen on the text view
the average button should calculate the users rating the users input's average
the return button takes the user back the main screen.
